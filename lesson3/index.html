            <h2 class="commH2">Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of This site is to ensure that local businesses are not alone. Together, 
                we build the economy for our local community through jobs, goods, services, and participation. In
                the West Jordan Chamber of Commerce, we provide a network where all voices can be heard and we can
                support one another. By supporting each other, we also support our community. They will now have a 
                forum to address members that current are working in our local economy.<br>
                <br>
                Subsequently, with a united voice small businesses can now be heard by local leaderships in government
                that may unknowingly or knowingly pass laws and statutes that will in turn make our businesses suffer.
                With a united front we can bring our influence and people from our town to stand together for the good
                of our community. We are especially valuable in a market where large monopolies, and global businesses
                look to replace us.
