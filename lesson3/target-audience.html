            <p>Our target audience for this website is both business owners, 
                and consumers looking for local businesses to support. Ideally, startups and
                established businesses looking for an ethical, honest, and supportive locale
                to build in would be so enticed by our website, they would connect with us.
                Consumers, local and visiting, would be able to visit the West Jordan Chamber
                of Commerce for local businesses, highlights, local political matters, 
                and general information. This double pronged approached mirrors our values
                of being open, accessible, and informative.

            <p class="personaPara">Hugh Mungous owns small gyms in other municipalities and has 
                contacted the West Jordan Chamber of Commerce to see if his business model 
                could be profitable in our region. A successful entrepreneur would be an 
                amazing resource for the Chamber of Commerce. Mentoring other small business 
                owners, leadership, and a voice of experience is always welcome.

            <img class="personaImages" src="../lesson3/images/TG_tianastemples.png" alt="online entrepreneur">
            <p class="personaPara">Tiana Bo Bana is an artist that is currently looking to move 
                to our city. She runs an online startup that is really taking off. She has
                asked if there are any other businesses that work in the art industry in our 
                membership. She is not looking to take market share from other local artists.
                Since her online business services primarily international and non-local 
                clients, the Chamber is not worried about that. In fact, our local print 
                and framing shop needs her business! She is looking for a caring community
                that work together more than compete. West Jordan is the place for her and
                her business. </p>
