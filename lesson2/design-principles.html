                Visual Heirarchy is the body language of design. Without explicity labeling
                it "most important" and "least important", we can use various indirect, subtle
                methodologies to communicate our priorities for those engaging with our design.
                Size, color, contrast, texture, and white space draw our eye and guide from the most
                obvious to the more inconspicuous. Taking advantage of human pattern recognition
                alignment (or lack thereof), repetition, and proximity can imply connections and
                importance by drawing attention to them.<br>
                <br>
                Simply Choclolate excel at emphasizing focus on their product by setting it as the 
                largest element sitting centered over the line the line of contrast separating the 
                top and bottom halves of the page. After being directed to the product, the eye
                drifts to the "shop" button, titles, and links. Simple, but effective.

            <h2>Tesla</h2>

                Boiled down Hick's law is the measure of time it will take for an individual to 
                reach a decision as a function of the amount of elements to choose from, and simultaneous
                occurring tasks. According to Hick's law, one can reduce reaction times by decreasing the 
                number of elements to choose from. Since designers cannot control what tasks a person
                engaging with their design may be juggling, we can incorporate minimized elements. <br>
                <br>
                Tesla adhers to this law beautifully by pragmatically limiting choices yet maintaining an
                aesthetically pleasing and efficient website.

            <h2>Apple</h2>
            <a href="https://apple.com">www.apple.com</a>

                Contrast in design can be argued as one of, if not the, most important part of a design. 
                Text that is the same color as the background is invisible. A busy image can make 
                overlapping elements difficult to see. Inversely, high contrast can effectively focus that
                people are not even aware of how their eyes are naturally going to where the designer wants
                to place them.<br>
                <br>
                Apple demonstrates contrast on their website with their products and text. On the upper part
                half of the image, has a deep purple background with lighter phone models angled in a way that the 
                contrast forms leading lines to the light colored text. Conversely, the lower half has a dark
                product with dark text. A very effective use of contrast.
