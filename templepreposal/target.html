                    <p>John and Jane are in their first year of marriage. Instead of a honeymoon abroad they decided to travel the states and visit all 81
                        temples. They made a schedule and contacted Temple Inn & Suites after comparing other hotels online, booking a honeymoon suite for
                        each stop. John and Jane were able to work out an extended stay rate to help them as they built their marraige on the surest of foundations.

                        Janie is a convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and set a goal shortly after baptism to become worthy to do baptisms
                        in the temple for those who never had the opportunity while they were here on earth. She recently got a temple recommend but had no way to 
                        get to the closest temple that was a 5 hour car ride away. As if by coincidence, the Bishop has announced a two day youth temple trip that 
                        all will be accomodated at Temple Inn & Suites. Not only will Janie have a way to get to the temple, the group rate for lodgings are 
                        now affordable as well.

                        any that would fit their budget. That's when Ambers Mom, a patron of Temple Inn & Suites, suggested she look into their services. Amber was elated to find
                        Temple Inn & Suites offers gorgeous reception halls, complementary honeymoon suites, and a curated garden. Aaron and Amber can now look forward with anticipation
                        to their big day.

                        . There mission is large and their mission president has called a mission conference. The entire mission in one place! Missionaries will have an opportunity to hear from the
                        President, wife, and assistants in a spansive conference hall, and the next day attend the temple. Every Elder and Sister will never forget the spiritual experiences while at
